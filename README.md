## Univariate analysis
Univariate analysis is the simplest form of data analysis, focusing on one variable at a time to describe its characteristics, find patterns, and summarize data using measures like mean, median, mode, and frequency, often visualized with histograms or bar charts, helping identify outliers and data distribution without looking at relationships between variables.
It's thefoundational step in data exploration, essential for understanding individual attributes like height, age, or sales figures before moving to bivariate or multivariate analyses.

## Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis is a statistical method to study the relationship between exactly two variables, determining the strength and direction of their association, often using techniques like scatterplots, correlation, or regression to see how one variable changes as the other does (e.g., height and weight).
It helps researchers understand patterns, test simple hypotheses, and make predictions by identifying if variables move together (positive), in opposite directions (negative), or have no clear link, differentiating correlation from causation.
## Multivariate analysis
Multivariate analysis (MVA) is a set of statistical methods for analyzing data with multiple variables simultaneously, revealing complex patterns, correlations, and relationships that single-variable (univariate) or two-variable (bivariate) analyses miss, helping to understand how factors interact in real-world scenarios like marketing, science, or finance for better predictions and decisions.
